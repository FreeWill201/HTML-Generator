# Description

Code creates functionality through VS Code that successfully renders an html file that fills appropriate spots with information the user is asked for through a CLI. Can be used to add as many employees as needed that work under a manager, whether that employee is an intern or an engineer. Code is designed to make it simple to create a detailed and unique html file that properly renders code according to the user's input. 

# Installation

Code is installed by referencing several html templates through handlebars that are referenced in the generatehtml.js file which is then referenced through the index.js file. Tests are created for each class that return whether the code is properly working to distribute it's specified variables. Inquirer, jest, and handlebars all need to be installed to properly render the code. By linking the seperate files to a couple main files that serve to render the code's aims the functionality is made possible. 

# Usage

Code is designed to be used by someone who wants to deploy a website generator for people who want a site to quickly be made and for it to match their specific needs. The code served to automate this process and allow the user to simply enter in their information as prompted in order to create a costum website through the created html file that lines up with their input given in the CLI accordingly. 

# Credits

Credits to the npm packages Inquirer, Jest, and Handlebars. Further credits to VS Code and all online reference sites such as Google, Youtube, and Full Stack Academy. Without the files and sites mentioned it would not have been possible to create this functionality.
